# Point-to-Line-Segment-Collision-in-Java
Point-to-line collision algorithm.

I recommend viewers to watch my Line(segment) Intersection tutorial here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3hYp0639lc&t=0s

An understanding about line vs. line intersection is helpful for understanding this topic. This project demonstrates collision between a point and a line segment.

THis project is explained in this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObCgBRSsF0o

The 'Complete' directory contains UI codes and collision algorithms. The 'Setup' directory contains UI codes and doesn't contain point-to-line collision algorithm. Use the files in 'Complete' folder for your reference and use files in 'Setup' folder if you wanna follow my tutorial that I mentioned above.
